## How It Works

### Detection Methods

1. **Domain Analysis**:
   - Checks for suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, etc.)
   - Detects typosquatting attempts
   - Identifies IP addresses instead of domain names

2. **URL Pattern Recognition**:
   - Analyzes URL structure and length
   - Detects suspicious keywords and patterns
   - Checks for excessive subdomains

3. **Security Indicators**:
   - Verifies HTTPS usage
   - Checks for valid SSL certificates
   - Analyzes domain age and reputation

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Uses trained models to classify URLs
   - Learns from user reports and feedback
   - Continuously improves detection accuracy

### Risk Scoring

The extension calculates a risk score from 0-100% based on:
- Suspicious domain patterns (30 points)
- Typosquatting detection (30 points)
- URL structure anomalies (20 points)
- Security indicators (10 points)
- Keyword analysis (10 points)
